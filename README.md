# What is this Project

This project was initially done as I received an invitation to build one company
new website. The website should be inpired on the regnskogfondet fouding page to
save the rain forest.

The website homepage should have had a 3D map in the background and after
loading the user should be presented with a camera tour, like an airplane flying
through a map, until we reach one of the company's locations. Once we reach this
location a popup should emerge with photos or videos and invite the user to
click and explore the location and it's services.

As I did not have the time, the means or even the skills necessary for such
build I refused. Instead

I still had the Idea on the back of my mind and so I decided to do this sample
project. In it's core it follow the same ideas but in a 2d approach.

# Why is this public if not finished

I decided to leave this project as public as this was an excelent mapbox
playground. I make it available for everyone as I faced a few strugles trying to
make everything work together and this example might help other people.

# What is left to be complete

This is but a sketch but there are a lot of things left to be done and other
features that could be added.

1- Better color and styling (it was not my focus) 2- Choose other Routes or add
more layers 3- Add a Services page (Services Homepage) 4- Add Services/id page
(:id = locations) 5- Add a news page 6- Add a Track and Trace page 7- Add a News
page 8- Add Authentication 9- Add an Admin page

I am sure there's much more it can be done and improved.

Remember this is just here in case anyone wants to use it as example for
mapbox-gl
